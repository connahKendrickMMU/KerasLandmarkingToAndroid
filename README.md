# KerasLandmarkingToAndroid
Keras with tensor flow backed, used for facial landmarking. We use android studio to load the model onto mobile device using opencv to detect faces and the trained networks to landmark.

The code to run the model on a android device can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b71grh4ec2hrgbj/AppFinal.zip?dl=0 
If you want to run your own model on the device you need to: 
- change the input/ output layers to match 
- adjust the program to work with the image size you want 
- adjust so it draws the correct amount of landmarks
